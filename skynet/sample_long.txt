Whatever Taco a small bag but went on a full tangent and started by trying to fix a fix bag that was missing somewhere but then I noticed some irregularities around display the important this training and eventually I;Mihaela: I agree with someone;Mihaela: and I also have the same with him;Horas: today's support guilty not so many things that are like three or four tickets all related;Horas: the quality of the meeting they are complaining the;Horas: love you do a snot out of sync with audio sometimes and sometimes it's blurry;Horas: isn't that at least for some hot Asana for work some meetings a meeting with Anna and one of the situation and they helped us;Horas: half the image the screenshot taken in the in the event election thing say it being saved on the CSS;Horas: MPG;Andrei Gavrilescu: yellow plated some training and investigated the issue with green where they are tracking for wasn't showing the problem fixed;Andrei Gavrilescu: extended;robert oanta: oh I continent without factoring history so some discussions that they had me to go to your house yesterday I found out that the tasks were generating some reason action items;robert oanta: and I have expected so it did end up beating our internal Bay County Library;robert oanta: actually hung music.;robert oanta: the Port Saint Lucie, basically optimizing;Emil Ivov: what do we want to discuss;Mihaela: but she's going to drain it;Yana: so before so John can write is there a way to improve the email do you understand that you should expressing so we yes so we have a very often reports from like let's play the recording;Emil Ivov: do you want to say;Yana: horse about missing recorded and mostly from Brave but other people as well and we can discuss why;Yana: there's anything like more major there that's we can fix but what I wanted to discuss now is that they always give us the recording me and everytime I have to go back and ask them can I give us the URL of the meeting they most of the time;Yana: I was thinking is there a way to;Yana: we have that you're out right away when we have a recording you were out to find the recording;Oana: I came up with an idea ID;Oana: dogs and we have them you found watch now we would find a recording session ID and envelopes will find the meeting URL but this is not the only case we have;Oana: in the feedback like just missing recording or something without fathers;Yana: if we don't have any other information that's fine but you should have the recording link we should be able to like find it without asking back customer what was the actual;Yana: that's my only said that we go back and ask them if they'll;Emil Ivov: so I didn't want to get you the meeting out of the recording or no;Oana: technically yes but I tried to search getting the locks in the Jeep by the fish by the Jeep by the recording session ID and there I can't find them;Yana: so but why is it called silly because they rotate and we might have lost it already;Oana: Nikki MacCallum for today I think this happened recent;Yana: biscuit from yesterday;Yana: finding things like if we received five requests for days and then we'll be probably worried about that;Emil Ivov: an automated if that would have made the way;Oana: we should fix Nation;Yana: that's for sure yes but yeah can we all tomato;Emil Ivov: fix the issue anyway;Yana: find out what's going on there okay so can you try to look up those to request that they sent I sent you another one;Yana: play any differently in the one where it ended up on the different regions also an interesting one can you look up those and when you're looking for that;Yana: we make it easier for us to the search for those in the future;Oana: turn off.;Emil Ivov: okay what do we eat and we talked a little bit about what is causing this why do we have lost recording;Emil Ivov: anyone know;Oana: not sure yet I can explain how this happened and maybe you know more if you want me to;Oana: if you're on the deployment;Oana: you're going.;Oana: doxey Family theme song;Oana: I want release;Yana: a shart;Oana: and weeks back. According to be started by a Gymboree in this week so;Oana: in a bucket in the same region has permission to go in history;Oana: newscenter1;Oana: do we have a case where two different user the region will show as accepted for me it was in Rihanna;Yana: if we're looking at The Shard region now we're on the same shot shot.;Yana: but yes;Oana: because we send them the the link of the recording When recording;Oana: happy news;Oana: don't know why this was not the case why was like why we selected the US instead do this is how it should work;Emil Ivov: so you know that in this case we know that in this case the recording was in US.;Oana: Jimmy will be for me;Oana: what no I don't know yet;Yana: it could be a conference moves so we do see the same region I'm in the US and I see you Central one because we're on the show;Yana: drawing to someone from you guys and they ended up being a franchise charge;Yana: so;Yana: the only reason is we can move sharks in the middle of the meeting this can happen sometime so I'll discuss with that we can but then people cheer reload;Yana: is that something that there was another anomaly in the movie;Emil Ivov: well that doesn't mean that they'll say it necessary but okay we have to investigate this and then once we know;Emil Ivov: I was going on to be able to do to decide what;Yana: but independently there is a missing recording thing or am I mistaken the one that I sent you another one this morning;Emil Ivov: should we continue to discuss this with everyone else;Yana: yes I just wanted to say this is a different one that I sent this morning okay;saghul: what time;Emil Ivov: is that Rico and mindful that we kind of overstayed;Emil Ivov: topics that require everyone that don't require that would be beneficial;saghul: I think that we could discuss this like I don't think it's the kind of it's somewhat be so maybe we can;Emil Ivov: discuss it now but we can also let people go and then I'll just stay and wherever else you need;saghul: remember;saghul: going to things I have in my life yeah one is supposed to be sharing thing I told me about yesterday for the one is an election security;Emil Ivov: so this sounds like something we can start to discuss between the two of us;Emil Ivov: well everyone asks you for you to feel free to go and so you can share with me already whoever is interested;saghul: translate by the way;saghul: so the first one is the let me start from the election security;saghul: thought I had passed all of the holes but in the past before the whole shake-up happens Bogdan has worked on a full mitigation for this bike which would close it completely involves changing the way Wayne both.;saghul: a hole between the electron renderer process and the iPhone and that's why basically everybody ends up becoming remote code execution bug the way to avoid that is to use the information;saghul: they just need to be switched over to finish but because of all the shenanigans that have happened;saghul: no security shenanigansen happened now this has happened;saghul: the question is;Emil Ivov: what what are you asking for exactly do you need someone to help;saghul: is the kind of thing where we need to still support the old way or we would break is going to share it with everybody and then the Kaiser updated we can rotate the feature out that we could make a change;saghul: call Morgan;saghul: submerged tests and there I don't think there is space;Emil Ivov: where's the urgency that we have in Salt Lake;Emil Ivov: well let's see once we get someone;saghul: what's right in the form of security;Emil Ivov: Okay so;Emil Ivov: let me think a little bit about this the very worst once we get up for yourselves a little bit with with the whole LM stuff and contacts Center Stuff Etc and and then the authentication stuff try to put some time into this also lets you and I catch a buzz when I think about;saghul: DC stats and its relationship with with watch IDC so like looks like the most likely scenario anywhere that they would want to go with watch are teasing so if the spear like whatever it's called right now in Seattle;saghul: problem with either which is because both of them both and latex projects rely on monkey patching the peer connection they cannot be used at the same time;saghul: Youfit;saghul: unfortunate side effect here is that what your PC does not seem to support;saghul: they wired it out they don't have to login they kind of wire application looks so I guess we could we have two choices we can reach out to see if that is something on the pipeline and put make sense or what;saghul: at a certain way of operations what is he stands where it doesn't gather study the other slugs do we can have both;Andrei Gavrilescu: I wanted to say that this could technically be included in the logs part shipping box;Emil Ivov: I'd suggest;Andrei Gavrilescu: I don't think it's too much work to add the mode where logs are sent separately so I can probably fit this in the logs thing as well;Andrei Gavrilescu: that's reasonable but one thing I'd like to ask is if we do any Pilates she starts and whatnot that the guys have a problem with their meetings are they going to say are they going to send us watch Odyssey links for us to analyze work or whatever;saghul: yes;Emil Ivov: that's that's yes that's what I'm going to do;Emil Ivov: that's the right thing to do exactly for that reason we cannot tell people hey you know the lyrics to;Emil Ivov: but you we have Partners you can go use the partners and they go okay cuz of your insufficiency we're going to go and spend more money using someone else and the next thing we tell them;Emil Ivov: you anymore haha it's it's not that you don't see how this look if we can fix it they both work together I should be a preferred option so I suggest;Emil Ivov: we added support for which our DC breaks for RTC stats support and and we can't wait;Emil Ivov: please you know let's work together on on on on a on a solution;saghul: and breaking up with somebody else or just sorry I mean;Yana: I lost you;Andrei Gavrilescu: it broke up;Emil Ivov: we can ask them to;Emil Ivov: I was saying let's reach out to Taki and let's tell him;Emil Ivov: itzhaki your washer to see brakes are stats right now and that was probably already but we can just bring it up again and we need you we need you to come up with a fix;saghul: we know because we only allowed one one of them too;saghul: is that so;saghul: we say that way it sounds like what we want is to have a mechanism by which both work at the same time force that sounds like a very unlikely scenario we will have two libraries that they have both monkey patched save your connection. Get stats to hijack it and do something beforehand;Emil Ivov: everything's possible rain;saghul: yes;saghul: what I'm saying is is where is our interests are we interested in getting full art to see starts functionality or are we interested in being able to gather location logs but every other analytics date;Emil Ivov: we want the full warranty since that's what you think about it this way what will happen in the nature is customers of ours like attend anywhere dumb and say your logs and stand suck you want something more evolved;Emil Ivov: we have Partners you can use that we want to avoid if we don't want the usage of a partner to compromise our way to support so;Emil Ivov: nothing but any solution that stops already C-SPAN compromises our way to support them even if it's because we don't automatically;Emil Ivov: people who are all our own Analytics;Emil Ivov: way to do this is our PC stats is not compromised in any way by the usage of water which means I don't know we got some multiplexing Lair when you munch packs with your connection or something but from a perspective that's the right way to do it so unless this ends up being;Emil Ivov: expenses should go in that direction and in order to fix the prohibitive the expensive side of things we can push sake to help is this is his thing we can ask;saghul: okay;saghul: I think one thing we could do I know it we can talk about it because I think we have at least I know we have to;saghul: we could both have to guess there's a nonzero chance that things just worked one monkey purchase first and the other one monkey patches after they both get there;Andrei Gavrilescu: minutes should;Andrei Gavrilescu: yep it should work technically;saghul: maybe that's one way to go about it and it's easier than with us;saghul: what waiting for investigation is sports Ahi to let us use the service;saghul: Beast;saghul: remote control screen share stuff so;saghul: to the wireless to screenshot it and the way it works is computer that access a remote in that case because sharing your screen wirelessly use you first connect us a little remote that you would make that a peer-to-peer connection first has the remote with the TV and then there will be a connection established between the remote and meeting the actual meeting and has been joined by assistant called proxy your connection;saghul: is establishing one-way pure connection where;saghul: scream and then it uses this as it's local a bill for the way this was built was by reusing GT connection the muck the GT the jingle search all of those except that connection the conference everything except the actually most of everything is smoke though it's just fake objects don't do anything it's just so we could reuse the logic in General Session;saghul: historically every six months or so very peculiar ways and it cuz of how this is where proxy thing is something that needs to be used for from both ends so that is one time is in in Legion she needs baked into the deployment and then the other house isn't delicious she needs that spot needs to use this you can easily spot the problem;saghul: thanks and also very very subtle API changes to severe breakage;saghul: he's finally fixed but I'm not happy about it because we will inevitably run into this;saghul: broken now anymore pilot so I was playing on Creighton and Architects to the place to Prague and when they buy ABC gets updated it will work;saghul: and the way would be to use the iPhone API as a transport for negotiating this expert Care Connection I'm instead of all of that stuff and we would not have those tiny and subtle dependencies;saghul: resources from the deployment if Starbucks will fix them all in one generally speaking and;saghul: Camille dad's waiting to spend time with this so I thought of;saghul: cool feature so I thought that actually is there could be at your skates around and I thinking sternal streams D is the page that is using the iframe video source that once GT2 you just eat local video. It's impossible;saghul: implementing a connection transport across the ice cream boundary we can so we can send that stream to mainside meeting and then a meeting;saghul: local ice cream in general there is no reason why this to you you you're drawing something in a canvas and you wanted that to be your local feed;saghul: I Love Your Way;Yana: not at all;Emil Ivov: I thought your question was for everyone else;saghul: just want to make sure that everybody;Emil Ivov: where did I would look at this is;Emil Ivov: intuitively I like the idea of being able to plug in external get used to it it's it's it's something that's worth spending some time with you;Emil Ivov: probably as an experiment warrants less time than the fool spot rear axle so I would say;Emil Ivov: and maybe that's something that if you and we can discuss on the next Friday we can have I don't know if it's worth chordify how much time at any point are we spending in experiments but we can we can make sure that at any point it needs what we ate so is being the case that some of us are working on something that we don't really know how popular that will be but we want to try it;Emil Ivov: we're implementing;Emil Ivov: wait;Emil Ivov: Colonel video services in the air we push it on a blog post maybe we do a bit of a video about it and we see if it picks up if we get one or two people who and do something with it;Emil Ivov: then we can coordinate and it becomes part of the APA and that has reduced by that much the effort necessary;Emil Ivov: to actually switch Spa;Emil Ivov: and even if it doesn't get picked up by people it stood there so when we get a little bit more time to continue pushing in Sparta Sparta squat;Emil Ivov: okay but let's started as a jazz project I truly mean it right with the idea of this is what we're doing here's the blog post I was just yesterday;Emil Ivov: I don't know some window;Emil Ivov: I do not think about something something else that you could use is a generating an avatar;saghul: we could use Gabby's talking robot web-dl;Emil Ivov: yeah that might actually be an alternative way of achieving some of the things that we wanted to cheat with boss I like that but we can use;saghul: yes I I like I like I thought if it's due to do it in that order it was also with wasn't my mind I said we can build and then sort of migrate to it and I'm comes maybe the next time you brace;saghul: it will not be necessarily a walk in the park on this but side there is number like the things that we need to untangle so I think building upon the external API sign will be a simpler thing than to unplug it from the other end but the look I took sounds like;saghul: looking at the future;saghul: thank you;Yana: thanks or thank everyone have a great Friday"
