"saghul: I update the circuit il-4 but using a thing and hasn't seen any development in years right now;saghul: OK Google forward the reason why we didn't do it earlier is because we would lose Prometheus Port apparently there is traffic library that works with later so we could do that;saghul: a place where it's got a ram to run and write the stupid client that send;saghul: connect hundreds of these clients to this thing and see how I understand;saghul: take it from the understand how it behaves I didn't read it without pinpointing where the memory goes I think it's spy with my end up in the same position I think we would not have understood the problem bullet before it goes;Răzvan: yeah but in the meantime it's unusable the entire thing so that's the thing I mean if more than I don't know if more you have more than 100 people on the same note because we're also doing say sticky sessions so what happens there's going to be a waterfall effect so the Fresno crashes the users try to reconnect you connect to another server all of them;saghul: how many of these things do we have;Răzvan: we have four of them and that's it;Răzvan: crash and the second one with the Deferred loan crash at the fourth one and then it will start looping crashing until until they decide to just Beat It;saghul: then we have;saghul: should we have this many services charge me General;Răzvan: there's also a cost concern I don't know we could spin up some more instances and dedicate them directly to this right now we are sharing the same instances with the other pods;saghul: I can't comment on the post;Răzvan: that's why we kept that's why we kept the memory;saghul: is this is on me. I guess we can start;Emil Ivov: okay;Emil Ivov: can I go the number one question is why are we doing this and there's two reasons we could be doing it and we know that there's a problem that someone has we're so that's not the case don't know of a specific problem that we're showing number two reason we could be doing this would be some amount of exploration;Emil Ivov: tortoise;Emil Ivov: down there so that people who might have some problem that along these lines would manifest that's the scenario;Emil Ivov: here's the labor to do some quantification every 10 years the people with the problem here is how much they're willing to pay here's exactly what their problem is like you could be sessions with three people we could be sessions with 3,000 people we would know exactly what the problem is and and we do these things would be able to quantify the amount of effort that it makes sense to put into this experimentation without a clear problem statement;Emil Ivov: to be very curtailed;Emil Ivov: do all of the things that I'm hearing here we don't even know that their Solutions so it's experimentation on top of the experimentation and experimentation might be justified in certain circumstances but not in ours do what we need to do here to patch up something make sense within the context of marginal experimentation we want to have something so that people would raise the subject on their conversation with sales on their support chats and and and catching one that thing to not be ridiculously;Emil Ivov: that we look into a wave patch this thing so that it;Emil Ivov: we used two ways that we believe break it's like not even close example would be once you have more than five participants we stopped joining people into the Whiteboard and we'll replace it with a screen that says you know sorry the of the Whiteboard is on these words 55 participants at this point if you want to know more details or something like that;Emil Ivov: bored;Emil Ivov: but we'll make it read only for something. But I'm not too confident about that one but something along these lines because that seems to be the only option.;Mihaela: why would anyone like to just support inquire about the white boards;Mihaela: if Jasmine for white boy for me;Emil Ivov: we are so first of all we could have a message that that directs people to Jazz we direct people to Jasper all sorts of reasons so that that does have some value;Emil Ivov: Wright also it will be much hatred more helpful if you know if we think that we owe the people who want to experiment with our Jazz usually more helpful to have this on Jazz and if we have a situation where we know that this thing works if we have clear parameters for which this thing works that I have no problem in enabling for jazz;Emil Ivov: we haven't done so far is because you know if it's not used;Emil Ivov: Browning services;Emil Ivov: not in the shape;Emil Ivov: if we lock it up so that each week so that people cannot crash and I'm comfortable putting it on jazz;saghul: the man listen this is so that we know how to crush it;Emil Ivov: so I agree that one of the concerns is that we don't even know exactly why it crashes so far;saghul: County Michigan;Emil Ivov: I don't want to investigate too much of anything around right but right now because we've already put effort into it;Razvan Purdel: but the email;Razvan Purdel: the crash yesterday so we could duplicate that I think;Emil Ivov: I think what you means if we don't know exactly be posted right that you sort of know we sort of know like there's a let me know once you evolve a lot of traffic things go to hell we don't know exactly why we don't know exactly how much traffic;Emil Ivov: do that that we know he's never crashes if it's three people we sleep we can count the objects and block it Beyond a certain number of objects that's what we do we put something where is just very very hard to crash it with these parameters;saghul: I'm thinking one thing of this bunch of said my magic win Excalibur has this thing where you see the other guy smiles when they are and they are painting writing all those miles over events generate the lothric we could.;Emil Ivov: so if we do that so that I I see what you're saying what bothers me is that it it it just moves one of the sliders a little bit of it doesn't stop things from crashing in in all circumstances it also the prices of one piece of functionality for which we don't even know how much it matters for the use cases that will be served by this because we don't know what they use cases are so this feels like what would you call it;saghul: might be the Band-Aid on winning but it's where I think that at least from the from the people I've seen the community ask about the Whiteboard limiting 25 participants would make it completely and you're smart;Emil Ivov: Band-Aid on a dyncorp;Emil Ivov: I'm very skeptical that this is going to save the patient;Emil Ivov: is completely unusable right now;Mihaela: that's not completely unusable and the fact that we have so much traffic means that people are actually using cards;Razvan Purdel: if this is exactly this is exactly what I wanted to say;Razvan Purdel: find its use Gates maybe don't know them people use it;Emil Ivov: I see I see what you're saying it is completely unusable in a situation where someone is paying for it there is no way you can be on jazz in its current shape right now there's no way we'll take someone's money and and and in inceldom this and there is no way;Yana: also it's good babe so also the use cases we usually see a difference between the use cases for my baby;Yana: you skate the five people could be usable for someone with their price eustasis more than it is for me;Emil Ivov: and even if it isn't the reason I wanted Am GT so I want this to be on jazz in order to be in Jasmine has to actually be stable cuz that's one of the reasons why people come to us and they don't deploy their own shit it because they're buying stability that's all we know at this point I wanted to be out there so that people would see that there's an option so that when they talked to says they can't I don't know this would be great but it it's it's unusable for me for five people yes you're right it might be a might be almost no music by people because people will know that we have this and they'll have a reason to approach the subject right now they they have much less reason cuz we have nothing like that;Emil Ivov: let's let's let's find some minimum set of parameters where this thing's almost impossible to crash;Emil Ivov: let's put them on and see if we get anything and if we get anything that will put more time into it and we'll think about experimenting of you know is ready going to be a solution to think about maybe we need to two tiers of users maybe we need people for contributors are people who are viewers so that not everyone is sending Cruiser movement maybe we need to limit the number of objects or early.;Emil Ivov: these Solutions we can do right now because we don't know what you stay;Emil Ivov: we're trying to serve we don't know which of these things are accepted when we;Mihaela: so can you please repeat how did you intend to test it like in a sandbox;saghul: well what I had in mind was to deploy these say let's say IBM and then deployed or three temporary IBM's way we run to know the process that creates let's say 100 connections and we run multiple of these processes in each machine;saghul: between 1 and 10 MB every x amount of time and because it should relay it across people like in the end up back in the funny thing about this back in thing is that is really pretty dumb like it doesn't care about if it's a whiteboard or not connect to a websocket join the room which is and so I could do your thing and send data;saghul: and just see how it behaves so a basic load testing for websocket Server pending;Mihaela: okay and we won't run into the same issue as you without the;Mihaela: 1 + 20;Mihaela: they're being some issues with that because they weren't actually actively participating on the white boy wouldn't have that situation here;saghul: no because the participants participate in the Whiteboard means that they are pulling around right on and that triggers sending data or we can simulate that by making these dumb things send random garbage on the 2nd;saghul: so where do you want to ask;Emil Ivov: 311 tour tickets;Yana: nothing but I refuse to submit minimum set of programs that makes this table and release it to babysit is that the next time;Emil Ivov: well I guess we want to run it on me Gypsy first to make sure that he really does no longer crash when with these parameters this we have it running for a month without crashing we could put in;Razvan Purdel: option option would be to Simply give it like a dedicated instant see how much RAM does really conceal;Yana: yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean;Emil Ivov: ABC problem is that so;Razvan Purdel: we never saw this;Razvan Purdel: maybe be I don't know the garbage;Emil Ivov: what what problem what do what do we achieve what do we achieve given a dedicated instance what what I'm trying to say is that this makes sense we are in a different reference if we're trying to stoop to make this thing work for specific conditions we're not in them in in the reference range reference;Razvan Purdel: but we are already there because yes;Razvan Purdel: everything gets 22 gigabytes of RAM maybe doesn't have the chance to clean up the rent cuz it gets killed before;Emil Ivov: write what I'm saying is;Emil Ivov: investigation of trying to figure out how much RAM it needs to be performed within the context of this is the problem that it has to solve eventually we have to know you know what this is NASA and for them they have no 500 people that want to be collaborating on this thing and they're willing to pay that much there for the amount of rain that we learn outside of this experiment;Emil Ivov: NASCAR Whelen;Emil Ivov: we introduced it makes sense to do it right now;Razvan Purdel: Maybe;Emil Ivov: no I don't know I don't know I might be the one manifest like that;Emil Ivov: our goal is to just signaled the existence of such a thing so that people with the with the Whiteboard problem with manifest and we can talk to them about what they need and then we can go and investigate and moving to the other frame of reference which is okay we want to be fine exactly what the parameters of these things are exactly when it crashes exactly why;Emil Ivov: we have which of those are compatible with the yusuke and we can go from there and we can potentially justify the time right now we can justify about half a day on see how to lock it up this is where I'm coming from;Emil Ivov: oh my God my did my parents used to do this to me and I hate you have a good evening;Emil Ivov: see how it does that make sense to you;Mihaela: yes but not entirely sure;Emil Ivov: about what;Yana: can I voice something if it's before mcelligot's can I can I try to voice their concern;Yana: correct me if I'm wrong they say maybe razvan and me I love those that you're worried;Yana: this approach is;Yana: we find a set of parameters that work;Yana: or small you should limit the number of people were still like number of objects or something else;Yana: leave it there and where there won't be any sent it to make it to work for me or like that this is not solving the problem of these things useful;Yana: try to voice what is your;Yana: turn that played with the with the approach;Mihaela: yes of course I'm not worried that we won't raise the limit we put one I'm worried that it will be, use this feature to most people because the astonished by how many people are in this meeting and the fact that whenever I get them alert that it's called Always crashing I can easily find;Mihaela: participants are using the word Bordentown;Yana: so you're worried that they'll stop using it and will not gather enough.;Mihaela: I'm not sure how exactly is it that you want to gather these data do you actually want me to tear the sales contact for jazz and see actual complaints from people or rather from the community college for kids hub;Emil Ivov: yeah we will figure something out need you to specifically you word some text around;Emil Ivov: Sprint at this stage if you if you have we might be able to solve your problem in GTA servers you're interested please reach out;Emil Ivov: something along these lines;Mihaela: let me think the number of participants what they noticed is that we have meetings that take a long time and I'm thinking that not everyone in that meeting you staying things then so we might limit to couple of socket ID then when those people are left no one is there to do on whiteboard anymore and I'm not sure if I can check later is there are those people in the meeting anymore;saghul: you mean you're worried that there's like;Emil Ivov: you're saying that we might be overly restrictive in in in the way that we do it and that there might be cases where it should work in at the end of a big meeting and that it won't work is very much;Emil Ivov: okay to me that's totally fine because again I'm not solely on that I don't think of this as solving a problem or specific group of people cuz I'm not aware what group of people that isn't exactly what they're doing I'm concerned about it so that such a group would manifest so that we can work on this more in case it is necessary this achieve that goal even if people in some conference might have had might have been able to extract a little bit more;Emil Ivov: okay ways to look at;Emil Ivov: engineering way and the product way the engineering way have technical puzzle;Emil Ivov: in order to produce a proper solution and I understand that every fiber is in in an engineer's body is screaming at this is how this has to be done in order to be a proper essay;Emil Ivov: is shrimp this exists under what terms did it exist and we need to solve that first before we're able to say the solving the engineering problem is we're holding it's worth doing and and under what conditions exactly what does train should be put on the engineering problem so for example you're saying there's a bunch;Emil Ivov: we have never had the objective of spending unlimited amount of money to sew ins for people who use any Kitty we simply cannot afford that;Emil Ivov: we're using me Jesse with a specific goal from a business perspective we all have our personal reasons as well but from a business perspective we're using me GT with the goal of a testing shouldn't be using it as a demo and Jazz;Emil Ivov: and insulting this problem is is outside was justified by the existence of this is to get more investment in terms of time we have to get confirm interest from Gas customer;Emil Ivov: does that make sense;Mihaela: sorry for taking the whole hour of this;Emil Ivov: please.;Emil Ivov: get this absolutely nothing to apologize for this is exactly why we have the meeting so that we will have exactly this discussion and I'm very happy that we're having this discussion so thank you for raising all of the things that didn't make sense to you and you're not just let him know as long as there're things that appeared after you that appears that they don't make sense or to anyone else please keep raising them that that's that's exactly what I'm hoping for so thank you for;Emil Ivov: do you feel that that that you understand;Emil Ivov: I look at this. What do you feel like I'm just going to shut up because I ate I don't really make sense of anything;Mihaela: I understand I'm going to;Mihaela: set some limits and forth some communication and we'll see where we go from there;Yana: let me know when you do so that we can release it as soon as possible to meet Jesse so that we can see;Yana: thank you okay will we have this recurring on Thursday so we'll get to the other topics;Yana: or even before that Disturbed;Emil Ivov: I think we have a couple of other stand-up things that we should probably do very quickly did anyone else had discussions from stand-up that they wanted;Gabi: I had something seedy mobile;Gabi: basically now we have we have targeted Beach rates for mobile are too high because they are fat.;Gabi: it's not the original stream and the B train is the same so we should I add like Pacific Beach rates for mobile so that we don't have that problem so that will be will be happy with this;Emil Ivov: we should we should we should be using the same rates as the ACT;Gabi: okay okay;Gabi: that was my question;Yana: thank you all"
